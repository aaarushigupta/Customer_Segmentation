# Customer Segmentation
This project consists of a mall customers dataset. \n
A R code has been written to explore the data and visualize the components. \n
The R Markdown feature was then used to use this code to make a visually appealing web page using HTML.
Finally, a report and a presentation was created to give a better understanding of the importance of the proble statement, along with a clear description on the methods and algorithms used in performing the data analysis and taking out conclusions.
